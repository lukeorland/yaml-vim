YAML.VIM and YAML collection sorting scripts:

INSTALLATION WITHOUT PATHOGEN:
- Put syntax/yaml.vim in vim's syntax folder (/usr/share/vim/syntax on my system)
- Put filetype/yaml.vim in vim's ftdetect folder
- If you want add a new enty to the syntax menu:
    an 50.110.370 &Syntax.WXYZ.Yaml :cal SetSyn("yaml")<CR>
- Put yamlsort.rb and yamlsort.vim into ~/.vim/scripts directory.

INSTALLATION WITH PATHOGEN:
- Just clone this as a submodule into your bundle/ directory.

SORT USE:
- TODO: |
    add a global variable to toggle yamlsort on/off (adds the ability to
    make add a custom key binding to toggle this feature)
- (Until the above TODO is done) Type vim command: |
    :source ~/.vim/scripts/yamlsort.vim
- Then: >
    <F4> is mapped to sort YAML collections in direct order, 
    and <F5> in reversed order.

NOTES:
- If you want change key mapping of sorting rules edit yamlsort.vim

TODO:
- Work with short notation of collections and mappings ({}, [])
- Support sorting of multiline values

Changelog:
  2010-02-19:
  - Merge Nikolai Weibull's rendition of yaml.vim (thanks to Phill Baker).
  2002-06-09:

  - >
    If any record of collection does not key field (i.e field which
    value is used in sorting), it is placed to the end of collection.
